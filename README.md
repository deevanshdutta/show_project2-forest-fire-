This project uses a Ridge regression model to predict the forest fire weather index based on meteorological parameters. The model was trained and saved as a pickle file along with a scaler for data normalization, allowing predictions directly through the web application.

Features
Predictive Modeling: Uses Ridge regression to estimate fire weather risk.
Interactive Web Interface: Built with Flask, allowing users to enter data for prediction.
Data Preprocessing: StandardScaler normalizes data inputs for improved prediction accuracy.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
Flask
Scikit-Learn
Numpy
Pandas
Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/deevanshdutta/show_project2-forest-fire-/tree/main/FWI-main.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd FWI-main
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure the ridge.pkl model and scaler.pkl files are in the models_pkl directory.

Start the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Go to the home page.
Enter the following parameters for prediction:
Temperature: Current temperature (Â°C).
Relative Humidity (RH): Humidity level (%).
Wind Speed (Ws): Wind speed (km/h).
Rain: Rainfall (mm).
FFMC, DMC, ISI, Classes, Region: Forest fire-specific parameters.
Submit the form to receive a prediction.
Model Training
The model was trained using Jupyter notebooks, which handle:

Data Cleaning: Managing missing values and preparing the dataset.
Scaling: StandardScaler normalizes the data.
Model Training: Trains a Ridge regression model on processed data.
File Structure
app.py: Main application file for running the Flask server.
models_pkl/: Directory for serialized model (ridge.pkl) and scaler (scaler.pkl) files.
templates/: HTML templates for the web interface.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model training.
